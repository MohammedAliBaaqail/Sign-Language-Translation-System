# TensorFlow Lite Object Detection 

### Overview

This is a camera app that continuously detects the objects (bounding boxes and
classes) in the frames seen by your device's back camera, using a quantized
[MobileNet SSD](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)
model trained on the [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/).
